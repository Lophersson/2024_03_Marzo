As a QA (Quality Assurance) professional, there are several useful Chrome extensions that can enhance your testing efforts and improve productivity. Here are some important Chrome extensions for QA.

Postman: Postman is a powerful tool for API testing. The Chrome extension allows you to send requests, inspect responses, and debug APIs directly from your browser.

User-Agent Switcher: This extension allows you to change the user-agent of your browser, which is useful for testing how your website or application behaves on different devices or browsers.

Lighthouse: Lighthouse is an auditing tool built into Chrome’s DevTools. It generates performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO reports for web pages. This extension is great for evaluating the quality and performance of your web application.

Full Page Screen Capture: This extension captures the entire webpage as a screenshot, including areas that are not visible on the screen. It’s useful for documenting and sharing visual issues or for capturing the overall layout of a page.

Check My Links : The extension works by scanning a webpage and checking all the links within it for validity. It quickly identifies broken or dead links, which can be detrimental to user experience and negatively impact SEO. Broken links can lead to a poor user experience, disrupt navigation, and hinder search engine crawling and indexing of web pages.

These are just a few examples of Chrome extensions that can be valuable for QA professionals.
